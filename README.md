IN THIS PROJECT WE GET TO TEST OUT THE GITHUB ACTIONS, RENDER, AND POSTGRESQL DATABASE THROUGH RENDER. 

MAIN TOPICS HERE:
    -   CREATE MAIN.YML FILE TO DEFINE THE CONTINOUS INTEGRATION WORKFLOW. IN THIS FILE WE CAN SEE WHAT WE ARE BUILDING, TESTING, AND DEPLOYING
    -   WHENEVER A GIT PUSH IS EXECUTED THE GITHUB ACTION AUTOMATICALLY STARTS BUILDING, TESTING, AND THEN DEPLOYS THE CODE. IF ANY OF THE STAGES FAILS THEN THE CODE IS NOT DEPLOYED
    -   WE USE THE POSTGRESQL DATABASE SUPPLIED BY RENDER TO SEND AND RETRIEVE INFORMATION FROM THE TABLES CREATED IN FOR THE FLASK APP.
    -   SWAGGER DOCUMENTATION IS ALSO PROVIDED SO THAT THE USER CAN PERFORM CRUD ACTIONS WITH THE DIFFERENT ENDPOINTS PROVIDED.
